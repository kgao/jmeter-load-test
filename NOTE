## Apache JMeter

The Apache JMeterâ„¢ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.
Apache JMeter may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources, Web dynamic applications.
It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

## Test plans:

0. Make sure JRE 8 is installed. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html

1. Create test plan using GUI:
To run JMeter, run the jmeter.bat (for Windows) or jmeter (for Unix) file. These files are found in the bin directory. After a short time, the JMeter GUI should appear.
GUI mode should only be used for creating the test script, CLI mode (NON GUI) must be used for load testing.

jmeter.bat
run JMeter (in GUI mode by default)
jmeterw.cmd
run JMeter without the windows shell console (in GUI mode by default)
jmeter-n.cmd
drop a JMX file on this to run a CLI mode test
jmeter-n-r.cmd
drop a JMX file on this to run a CLI mode test remotely
jmeter-t.cmd
drop a JMX file on this to load it in GUI mode
jmeter-server.bat
start JMeter in server mode
mirror-server.cmd
runs the JMeter Mirror Server in CLI mode
shutdown.cmd
Run the Shutdown client to stop a CLI mode instance gracefully
stoptest.cmd
Run the Shutdown client to stop a CLI mode instance abruptly

2. Add Scenario (Thread Group)

3. Add Endpoints 

4. Generate Reports (Save Service configuration, Summary.CVS, reportgenerator.properties)
